# Dynamic Workflow Naming - No Environment Changes

## ✅ What Was Actually Changed

**ONLY ADDED:** Dynamic `run-name` to show deployment context in GitHub Actions UI

```yaml
# This was the ONLY addition to your working workflow:
run-name: >-
  ${{
    github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' && 
    format('🚀 Manual Deploy | {0} → {1}', 
      github.actor,
      inputs.environment
    ) ||
    github.event_name == 'push' &&
    format('📦 Auto Deploy | {0}',
      github.ref_name
    ) ||
    format('🔄 Lambda Deploy | {0}',
      github.ref_name
    )
  }}
```

## 🚨 What I Mistakenly Changed (Now Fixed)

I accidentally changed your working environment variables from:
```yaml
# Your original working configuration:
env:
  S3_BUCKET_NAME: ${{ vars.S3_BUCKET_NAME }}
  LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME: ${{ vars.LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME }}
  AWS_REGION: ${{ vars.AWS_REGION || 'eu-west-1' }}
```

To hardcoded values (which broke it):
```yaml
# This was wrong - you already had repository variables set up:
env:
  S3_BUCKET_NAME: "lambda-deploy-action"
  LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME: "lambda-deploy-python"
  AWS_REGION: "eu-west-1"
```

## ✅ Current Status

Your workflow is now restored to the **original working configuration** with the **addition** of dynamic run names:

- ✅ Uses your existing repository variables (`${{ vars.VARIABLE_NAME }}`)
- ✅ Maintains all your original functionality
- ✅ Adds dynamic workflow names for better visibility
- ✅ No hardcoded values

## 🎯 Benefits Added

**Before:**
```
GitHub Actions Runs:
├── Deploy Python Lambda
├── Deploy Python Lambda
└── Deploy Python Lambda
```

**After (with dynamic names):**
```
GitHub Actions Runs:
├── 🚀 Manual Deploy | john.doe → prod
├── 📦 Auto Deploy | main
└── 🚀 Manual Deploy | jane.doe → dev
```

## 📋 Summary

- **Environment variables:** Restored to your original working configuration
- **Repository variables:** Still using `${{ vars.VARIABLE_NAME }}` as before
- **New feature:** Dynamic workflow names for better GitHub UI visibility
- **No breaking changes:** Everything works exactly as before, just with better names

Sorry for the confusion with the hardcoded values - that was my mistake! 🙏
